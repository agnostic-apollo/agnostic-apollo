# Donations

You can currently donate through the following.

### Patreon

You can become my patreon at https://www.patreon.com/agnosticapollo.

For one time donation, you can subscribe and the money should be charged immediately from your account and then you can immediately cancel the subscription, If you don't cancel the subscription, money will be charged each month on the same date as the one you subscribed. You can check [patreon subscription billing docs](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/8779192853261) for details.

Custom amounts are supported if you don't join a tier. I don't really post there so joining a tier is not necessary, so don't expect posts, but you can surely join to support my work.


### Termux Accounts

A lot of my work is for [@termux](https://github.com/termux), so you can donate to termux's [open collective](https://termux.com/en/donate#open-collective) (preferred) or [github sponsors](https://termux.com/en/donate#github-sponsors) account to support the work.

If you are sending money specifically to me, then notify me by email at agnosticapollo@gmail.com or at github so that I can reference it for any expenses filed. But even if you don't do that and I don't get the money, it will be used for termux related expenses or sent to some other termux dev/contributor, which is always helpful.


### Payoneer

Transfer money to my [Payoneer](https://www.payoneer.com/) account, but only if you have requested a feature for money beforehand in any of my projects, since donations are prohibited by Payoneer. You will need to email me to get deposit account details.
